### This is my solution to the
### [freeCodeCamp Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker) project.
 
#### A live version of this app can be found [here](https://boilerplate-project-exercisetracker.phr0nesis.repl.co)

This repository requires a .env file to function correctly, specifically it needs PORT and MONGO_URI variables.
This project was tested using PORT=3000.
In order for this to work, you *will* need a [MONGO_URI](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/).

## Warning: By default, your entire database will be dropped upon program restart, to disable this, see the comment @ line 22 of server.js.
